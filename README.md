This is a website on the Guessing Game
The theme will be futuristic, space-like with the loveable pessimistic robot marvin
from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
Note: the stars background is not mine, I took it from the foundation css website


plans for interactive features
after you put in a number, marvin's "text box" updates with a pessimistic response
if you are wrong, the counter gets lowered
